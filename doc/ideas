Simple Build Server
===================

INI config file
* Each section is a build
* In each section:
  * Init script (which is passed the directory path to create)
  * Poll interval
  * Poll script path within repo (which is run in the directory)
  * Build script path within repo (which is run in the directory)

Global config options
* Output path
* Working directory

At startup, write a JSON file to the output path that lists the builds.

Whenever a build completes, write data about it to a JSON file in that
build's output directory.


Internal Structure
==================

After startup, a separate process is spawned for each build. The processes can
be caused to force a build immediately by sending SIGUSR1.

Each process sets its name so that the process for a particular build can be
easily identified.
