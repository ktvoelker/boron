Add build commands into the UI

Interpret exit codes other than 1 from poll as indicating a failure to poll

  This should not trigger a build or create a new build file

  Just update index.json so that "latest" is not a real build, but a special
  build indicating a failed poll (that way, you don't accumulate a huge list of failed
  poll entries - you just have the latest)

Implement support for StopBuild command

Implement all remaining todos

Include information about how each build was started

Output a trailing newline to JSON files

Write documentation

Write tests

Prevent unnecessary UI flickering

Make file writes atomic (or at least closer, by writing a temp file and then moving it)

Fix the missing base path in the directory indices

Figure out why the server sometimes hangs or returns broken files
