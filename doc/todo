Implement nice view classes

  Each one takes in a DOM node (the render target) and a model object

  To make sure we keep track of all views in memory (in order to destroy them later),
  we will need some "container" views

Rewrite the UI using the new view and model classes

Display nice build numbers, pass/fail, and start time in the numbers list

Fix the missing base path in the directory indices

Tests!
