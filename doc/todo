Display start time in the numbers list

Display last-pass status and last-start time in the build list

Get rid of the redundant layers of caching, hopefully simplifying everything

  1. Model objects should be stateless wrappers around URLs that return promises
     in response to all requests for data
  2. URL access can then go through a local cache (like the one we already have, but
     perhaps a bit smarter)

Keep the web UI up-to-date automatically (with WebSockets?)

Fix the missing base path in the directory indices

Figure out why the server sometimes hangs or returns broken files

Tests!
