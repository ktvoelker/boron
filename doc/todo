JS Rewrite

  Move the "selected" state into the models and use events to keep the views current

    This will make it easy for the router to set the initial state when creating views

  Implement the router module

  Update the CSS to handle the new views

Display nice build numbers, pass/fail, and start time in the numbers list

Fix the missing base path in the directory indices

Tests!
