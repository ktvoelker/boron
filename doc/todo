TODO
====

Add "lazy" support to the List view: you give it lazy promises of views, and it only
forces enough of them to fill the screen, plus a bit more. It renders more when you
scroll.

Change the radio-button activate methods to go through the router

Update the CSS to handle the new views

Display nice build numbers, pass/fail, and start time in the numbers list

Get rid of the redundant layers of caching, hopefully simplifying everything

Fix the missing base path in the directory indices

Tests!
